# SSM Library

## Description

The SSM (Surrogate Safety Measures) Library is a comprehensive library focused on providing surrogate safety measures in traffic analysis. It's primarily based on measures such as Time to Collision (TTC), Gap Time (GT), Encroachment Time (ET), Deceleration Rate (DR), Proportion of Stopping Distance (PSD), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), and Initially Attempted Post-Encroachment Time (IAPT). The objective is to provide a tool that allows for a more in-depth analysis of traffic conflicts, focusing not only on frequency but also on severity.

## Installation

For now, you can install this library by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ssm-library.git
cd ssm-library
```

In the future, we plan to package this library and make it available on PyPI.

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the library in your Python projects as follows:

```python
from ssm_library import your_module

# use the module here
```
